    <h1>Disclaimer for HyperMesh Investment</h1>
    <p>HyperMesh is a decentralized compute network designed to power AI, blockchain, and gaming through distributed global computing resources. While our mission is to create a powerful and sustainable Web3 infrastructure, we want to ensure all investors understand that participation in blockchain-based projects — including HyperMesh — comes with inherent risks, legal responsibilities, and potential market fluctuations.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>1. Market Volatility</h2>
    <p>The blockchain, AI, and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) sectors are subject to rapid and unpredictable market shifts. The value of HyperMesh tokens may rise or fall significantly over short periods. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2. Business Performance & Profit Adjustments</h2>
    <p>HyperMesh is committed to rewarding early adopters and investors through staking incentives, referral systems, and other profit models. However, all rewards and returns are directly tied to ecosystem performance, token economics, and real-world adoption.</p>
    <p>In the event that HyperMesh cannot maintain the same level of revenue or user activity in the future, we reserve the right to adjust and reduce the daily rewards or profit percentages to protect the network’s sustainability. This is essential for long-term viability and risk mitigation.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>3. Legality of USDT Investment & Investor Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors are solely responsible for ensuring that the USDT they use for investing is obtained through legitimate and legally compliant means.</li>
      <li>HyperMesh does not assist in the acquisition of USDT. Investors must procure USDT on their own, using licensed and regulated platforms or exchanges.</li>
      <li>If you are located in countries with stricter regulatory environments (e.g., India, UAE, etc.), it is your duty to ensure:
        <ul>
          <li>Compliance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) or equivalent financial regulations.</li>
          <li>Proper source-of-funds verification and AML compliance for the USDT you invest.</li>
          <li>Reporting of digital asset holdings or income as per local tax laws (e.g., India’s 30% VDA tax and 1% TDS).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>HyperMesh and its affiliates disclaim all responsibility for any legal or regulatory violations committed by investors during the process of acquiring or transferring USDT. If you are uncertain, you are strongly advised to consult a qualified legal or financial professional in your jurisdiction before investing.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>4. Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
    <p>Blockchain and digital asset regulation is still evolving. HyperMesh tokens are not recognized as legal tender in most jurisdictions, and future policies may impact their use, taxation, or trading. Investors should remain informed and compliant with local regulatory developments.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>5. Security and Risk Awareness</h2>
    <p>HyperMesh implements strong security protocols; however, risks like cyber attacks, phishing scams, and smart contract vulnerabilities remain present in the Web3 space. We recommend investors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use only secure wallets.</li>
      <li>Keep private keys confidential.</li>
      <li>Avoid suspicious or unofficial platforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>At HyperMesh, we are building a next-generation decentralized infrastructure with transparency, innovation, and utility at its core. However, it is important to acknowledge that participation involves risk. Our role is to provide you with clarity and transparency — your role is to invest wisely and responsibly.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>By investing in HyperMesh, you confirm that:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You fully understand the risks associated with digital asset investments.</li>
      <li>You have acquired and used USDT through lawful and compliant means.</li>
      <li>You take full responsibility for your investment decisions and their consequences.</li>
      <li>You accept that daily profits, bonuses, or rewards may be adjusted based on project performance.</li>
      <li>You are compliant with all applicable laws, including foreign exchange, taxation, and crypto regulations in your country.</li>
    </ul>
